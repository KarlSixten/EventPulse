# EventPulse ü•Å

EventPulse is a full-stack web application designed to connect users with local events and empower event creators. Users can discover public and private events, find nearby happenings, invite others, and manage RSVPs. Event creators have the ability to create, edit, and delete their events.

This project was developed as an exam project for a full-stack development course focusing on Node.js, Svelte, and related technologies.

## ‚ú® Features

* **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up, login, and logout functionality.
* **Event Creation & Management:** Users can create public or private events, providing details like title, description, date/time, and location (latitude/longitude).
* **Event Discovery:**
    * Browse upcoming, past, or all events.
    * Sort events by date or distance (if location services are enabled by the user).
    * View event details, including location on a map (for events with coordinates) using Leaflet.js.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18.x or later recommended, project uses >=16 for server, >=18 for client tooling)
* npm (usually comes with Node.js)
* PostgreSQL server installed and running with the PostGIS extension enabled.

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone [http://github.com/karlsixten/eventpulse](http://github.com/karlsixten/eventpulse) # Replace with your repo URL if different
    cd eventpulse
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    * Navigate to the `server` directory:
        ```bash
        cd server
        ```
    * Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
       
    * Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory by copying `.env.example`
    * Ensure your PostgreSQL database (e.g., `eventpulse` or your chosen name) exists and the user has permissions.
    * Set up the database schema and seed initial data:
        ```bash
        npm run resetDatabase # This will drop existing tables and re-seed
        # OR for a fresh setup without deleting:
        # npm run setupDatabase
        ```
        *(These scripts are defined in `server/package.json`)*

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    * Navigate to the `client` directory from the project root:
        ```bash
        cd ../client
        # Or from server: cd ../client
        ```
    * Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
       

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    * In the `server` directory:
        ```bash
        node app.js
        ```

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    * In the `client` directory:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        *(This script is defined in `client/package.json`)*
    * Vite will typically start the development server on `http://localhost:5173`.

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or your client's configured port).

## üìú Available Scripts

### Server (`server/package.json`)

* `npm run setupDatabase`: Creates database tables and the PostGIS extension if they don't exist. Does not delete existing data.
* `npm run resetDatabase`: Drops all tables, recreates them, and seeds initial data. Useful for a clean start.
* `npm run clearInvites`: Drops and recreates the `event_invitations` table.
* `npm run dev`: Starts both the backend server (using nodemon) and the frontend development server concurrently.
* `npm run prod`: Builds the client application and then starts the server in production mode, serving the built client files.

### Client (`client/package.json`)

* `npm run dev`: Starts the Vite development server for the frontend.
* `npm run build`: Builds the frontend application for production.
* `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally for preview.

## üìù Project Status

This is an exam project. While it demonstrates core functionalities, it may not be feature-complete or hardened for production use without further development (e.g., comprehensive error handling, security hardening, advanced features).
