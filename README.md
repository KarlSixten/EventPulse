# EventPulse ü•Å

EventPulse is a full-stack web application designed to connect users with local events and empower event creators. Users can discover public and private events, find nearby happenings, invite others, manage RSVPs, and purchase tickets for paid events. Event creators have the ability to create, edit, and delete their events.

This project was developed as an exam project for a full-stack development course focusing on Node.js, Svelte, and related technologies.

    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    * Navigate to the `server` directory: `cd server`
    * Install dependencies: `npm install`
    * Create a `.env` file and add your PostgreSQL details, session secret, email credentials, and Stripe keys (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`).
    * Set up and seed the database:
        ```bash
        npm run resetDatabaseSeed
        ```
